# Padel Club
 
 ## Welcome to my first Portfolio Project!

 This page for a Padel Club was an assignment for my Full Stack Developer-course on [Code Institute](hhtp://codeinstitute.net). 
 The choice for a Padel Club were actually random and the idea was to create a 'here we are, come join us'-type of page. 
 Padel has become a very popular sport in a very short time and with this page i wanted to stress that everyone can enjoy padel 
 and everyone should try it out.<br>Users of this website is meant be inspired to seek more information and/or sign up on the contact page.

 The live website can be found [here](link)
 
## Technologies Used

 For this project we were allowed to use two programming languages: 

 - [HTML5](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
 - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Design

### Colour Scheme

My two main colours used are white #fff and a nuance of black #252525. The purpose behind that was to create a easy to read, stylish contrast
that makes it easy for everyone to see regardless of device. 

### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Montserrat font while the main text is using the Source San Pro font.
I choose these fonts because they were a good match along with the black-on-white stylish colour scheme. 

### Imagery

Images were choosen to be inclusive and show of a varity of different people to inhance that padel is a sport for everyone. 
Size and placement may vary depeding on image and intendend devices displayed on.

### Bugs

#### Solved bugs
* Got an 'Warning: Consider using the h1 element as a top-level heading only (all h1 elements are treated as top-level headings by many screen readers and other tools).' error when validating my HMTL. 
    * Solved it by replacing the sections for divs.

### Deployment

    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the 'Settings' tab.
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the 'Master Branch'.
