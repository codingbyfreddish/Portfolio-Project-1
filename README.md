# Padel Club
 
 ### Welcome to my first Portfolio Project!

 This page for a Padel Club was an assignment for my Full Stack Developer-course on [Code Institute](hhtp://codeinstitute.net). 
 The choice for a Padel Club were actually random and the idea was to create a 'here we are, come join us'-type of page. 
 Padel has become a very popular sport in a very short time and with this page i wanted to stress that everyone can enjoy padel 
 and everyone should try it out.<br>Users of this website is meant be inspired to seek more information and/or sign up on the contact page.

## Technologies Used

 For this project we were allowed to use two programming languages: 

 - [HTML5](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
 - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Design

### Colour Scheme

My two main colours used are white #fff and a nuance of black #252525. The purpose behind that was to create a easy to read, stylish contrast
that makes it easy for everyone to see regardless of device. 

### Typography

The headers on all pages throughout the Website are using the Montserrat font while the main text is using the Source San Pro font.
I choose these fonts because i thought they were a good match along with the black-on-white stylish colour scheme.
